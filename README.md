Universal Windows 10 App (UWP) for SJCAM action camera

## Introduction

As I owned a SJCAM action camera recently (M20), I started to write an Universal app for windows 10 family. The idea is to support all the parameters from the camera. Currently I can only test on the M20 camera, as this is the only one I own.

## Features

- Auto connect to camera, the idea is to avoid the user that has to quit the app to connect
- Snap pictures and takes videos
- Adjust resolution, brightness, sharpness etc etc, well, to support all the camera settings
- Access to camera storage through network, and be able to retrieve photos and videos
- Sexy design (Important!)
- No ads
